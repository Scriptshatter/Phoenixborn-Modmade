<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>In this addon for minecraft origins, you get to play as the reworked version of my old <a href="https://github.com/Scriptshatter/Phoenix-born">PhoenixBorne</a> origin! Now with custom tools, and an entire new crafting station with custom animations! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wOyDS7H.png" alt="turnblast"> Don't worry, the temperature bar does return... With a new look! </p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6vdVSzZ.png" alt="tempature">
<h1>The Tools</h1>
<p>The tools that this mod adds are all reliant on heat, and in order to use them you have to charge them with the hotkey that is set. The default is \, but you can change that in options. </p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jENXmxZ.png" alt="optionsmenu">
<h2>The axe</h2>
<p>The first tool that is currently made, is the Phoenix Axe, made with 2 blaze rods and 3 Charged Amythest. It can be thrown to light enemies on fire, right before returning to you! And to top it all off, it has a nice spinning animation! </p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tOqAyUK.png" alt="axefirstperson"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GHmT4H1.png" alt="axeground"> <p>Not to mention, if you mine a tree while crouching, it'll mine the entire tree in one action! How convenient! It's a little weaker than a netherite axe, since Charged Amythest is so expensive, but with its extra abilities, it's more than worth it! </p>
<h2>The Pickaxe</h2>
<p>The Second tool is the pickaxe, which can smelt ores in an instant as long as you crouch while mining the ore. Add that with its ability to locate any ore by right clicking it first, and it's more than worth it the recipe! </p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9uZHL09.png" alt="findore">
<h2>The Shovel</h2>
<p>The third tool that has been made is the shovel, which while its passive ability is simply a small change to get a random nugget while mining gravel, its primary ability is being thrown down on any block that's mineable via a shovel and acting as a portable beacon! Note that, however, these effects only work for yourself and other phoenixborns.</p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/149DGXs.png" alt="grass"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ylmtds2.png" alt="sand"> 
<h1>The Turnblast</h1>
<p>The Turnblast is this mods custom crafting station. It can be used by holding down secondary, and using your flamethrower while the appropriate crafting recipe is placed in the back. Items can be placed by right clicking the back of the panel. </p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/A7bmiVY.png" alt="craftingexample"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/itoccsp.png" alt="spinning">
<h1>The rebirths, and other mechanics</h1>
<p>By making a Rebirth Charm and right clicking it, you essentially gain a 1-up. The number of rebirths you have can be seen in the top left corner, as seen in the earlier screenshots. When you get brought back, you will be given an effect that restores you to full heat, while also healing you and enhancing your stats. </p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YQ64YCO.png" alt="potioneffect">
<p>The main resource of this mod, the charged Amythest, is quite expensive. In future updates, it's planned to make the tools upgradeable, thus making charged Amythest less expensive. But for now, you'll have to pay quite the metaphorical pretty penny to acquire these tools. If you're in a pinch, these can also be used to gain heat. </p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/x05aNEN.png" alt="chargedrecipe"> <p>Lastly, your heat. Values have been changed, but here is where I'll REALLY need feedback. Everything I could think of changes your temperature, I may add the ability to make datapacks for modded compatibility in the future, but for now, you'll have to deal with everything that works in vanilla. There is a temperature changing action and command, however, so you can try and use that if you really want to try and add modded compatibility. Once you're at half heat, the more it goes down the more your stats will go down, until you start to freeze. </p>
